#How it works

This app will allow you to search for a gifs. You can type in anything in the add a gif box and once added a button will be created on the top. Once you click the buttong, gifs will populate on the page. 

The gifs will be still. In order to animate them, simply click on them. You can clikc on them again to stop them.

#Challenges

This was a fairl easy application to make. The only challenges were to know where to place the functions. If a click function is placed inside the incorrect function, this application would work properly.
